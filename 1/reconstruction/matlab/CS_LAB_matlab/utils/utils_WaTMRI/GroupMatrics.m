%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Tree structure in wavelet coefficients (2D).
% input: parentIndex. ith row are the parents of i.
%        gamma
% output: 
%         G      -- with GX=Z, X is the wavelet coefficients and Z is the
%                   coefficients with nonoverlap groups. 
%         GmatZ  -- sqrt(GmatZ*(Z^2)) is the L21 norm of Z, with group size
%                     2
%         GmatX  --  sqrt(GmatX*(X^2)) is the L21 norm of X, with group
%                     size 2. X is the original coefficients vector.
%         groups --  groups index in Z.  Z(i) belongs to the groups(i)th group.
